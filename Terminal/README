TMuX, ZSH, oh my ZSH and VIM files


To get my exact colouring scheme, use Chris Kempson's Base 16 shell found here:  [Base16 Shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) .

It also requires his Vim version which has all the colors and such. In my .vimrc theres little changes that need to be made.  Make them.  [Base 16 for VIM](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim)
